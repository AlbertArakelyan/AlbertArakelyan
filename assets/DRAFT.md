## 🌱 Mentorship & Community Impact

- **Mentored 3 generations of interns** - many now thriving at leading tech companies.
- I actively support newcomers, both in the workplace and through open source, helping them launch their careers and find their confidence.
- I’m always happy to **guide anyone through GitHub**, whether you are new and need help getting started, or want to contribute to open source for the first time.
- I strive to bring this same spirit to all my projects - welcoming contributors, providing clear guidance, and empowering others to grow and succeed.
